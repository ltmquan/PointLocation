# PointLocation
A project about the point-location problem

Description: there are in total 7 classes
 - Point and Line I created to represent a point and a line, with Line containing a few crucial functions (pointTest and
 intersect)
 - LineTree is the one containing the main method, has a lot of codes (mainly 'println's)
 - LineGraph is responsible for all the graphics
 
 -> How to run: I added a lot of instructions in the main method, so you can just read along and know what's happening
 
Note: there is also OUTPUT.txt and TEST_CASE.txt, which each contains 1 test case
