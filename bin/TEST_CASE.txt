This file contains an additional test case, also taken from the homework assignment

Compile:
This is a program to solve the point-location problem
You will be asked to input the number of lines you want to create, their coordinates, and the points' coordinates used for testing
The result will then show up
Enter number of lines: 
5
When you enter the lines' coordinates, make sure that each pair of points has at least one point as 0 or 1
And also, the numbers always have to be between 0 and 1
Enter line 1's coordinates(separated by a 'space'): 
0 0.12 0.23 1
Enter line 2's coordinates(separated by a 'space'): 
1 0.41 0 0.52
Enter line 3's coordinates(separated by a 'space'): 
1 0.2 0.3 1
Enter line 4's coordinates(separated by a 'space'): 
0 0.4 0.1 0
Enter line 5's coordinates(separated by a 'space'): 
1 0.35 0.1 1
Do you wish to test out the points on a graphical interface?
Enter 'y' to change to graphics or 'n' to continue on console
n
Ok then
Enter two points to begin test
Enter first point's coordinate(separated by a 'space'): 
0.95 0.1 0.11 0.5 
Enter second point's coordinate(separated by a 'space'): 
Line 1 crosses the two given points
Number of external nodes: 12
Average path length: 3.6666666666666665
Do you wish to continue testing?
Enter 'y' to continue or 'n' to quit
Enter 'change' to change the original lines
n
Have a nice life!
